# Methane Measurement Study

This repository contains the code and scripts for the methane measurement study: S2Download.java and MBPD.py. The former Java script is for dowloading Sentinel-2 satellite imagery from Google Earth Engine. The latter Python script is for methane retrieval from Sentinel-2 satellite data and subsequent calculation of emission rates based on the retrieved concentration enhancements. The retrieval process involves multi-band-single-pass (MBSP) and multi-band-multi-pass-multi-comparison-date (MBPD) methods. The MBSP method is under license of GHGSAT Inc.

## S2Download.java

### Description

The `S2Download.java` is a Java script for downloading Sentinel-2 satellite imagery from Google Earth Engine.

### Usage

Run the codes in Google Earth Engine to download imagery.


## MBPD.py

### Description

The `MBPD.py` is a Python script for the multi-band-multi-pass-multi-comparison-date (MBPD) methane retrieval and quantification algorithm from Sentinel-2 imagery. It does methane retrieval and calculates emission rates based on the retrieved concentration enhancements.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- SciPy
- PIL

The MBSP method is from Varon et al. (2021):

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zhanzhangqq/Dissertation.git
cd MethaneMeasurement
```

2. Modify the script as needed, adjusting file paths and parameters.

3. Run the script:

```bash
python MBPD.py
```

### Functionality

#### Methane Retrieval (MBSP)

The `gridretrieval_MBSP` function retrieves methane concentration enhancements based on Sentinel-2 reflectance data. The results are visualized.

#### Plume Mask Generation

The `generateMasks` function generates binary plume masks based on the retrieved concentration enhancements. The `qvalue` parameter controls the threshold during mask generation.

#### Normalization

The `NormalizeObservation` function performs extreme value removal and normalization to the retrieved concentration enhancements.

#### Methane Retrieval (MBPD)

The `MBPDRetrieval` function implements multi-band-multi-pass-multi-comparison-date (MBPD) retrieval. It visualizes the subtraction results and generates plume masks.

#### Emission Rate Calculation

The `EmissionRate` function calculates the emission source rate (kg/s) based on retrieved concentration enhancements, wind speed, and plume characteristics.
